2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added some more documentation. POD coverage is still abysmal, Test-Pod-Coverage complains quite loudly.

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Add the IO-Journal temp (xs|c|o) files to MANIFEST.SKIP

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added new files to MANIFEST
	- Added .tmp files and Build.bat to MANIFEST.SKIP

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Remove all the libjio files, since they should be installed with Alien now
	- Add Alien::Libjio to build_requires and requires

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Added a bunch of standard author tests

	Some other minor oopsies

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Oops, typo'd $self should have been $class

2009-07-25  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added ppport.h for portability
	- Cleaned up POD

2009-06-02  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added example directory
	- Moved libjio source out of src

2009-06-02  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Fixed typo

2009-06-02  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added libjio source files (this probably breaks build; we'll see)
	- Minor changes to Build.PL
	- Mostly documentation changes in Journal.pm
	- Formatting changes in Journal.xs; fixed a typo

2009-04-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Moved syswrite from Transaction to Journal

2009-04-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added bootstrapper for IO::Transaction::Journal module
	- Changed IO::Journal's flag parameter to mode, to better represent what it's supposed to be - an Fcntl mode
	- Set up jopen'ed files properly when O_APPEND mode is chosen
	- Provide a typedef shortcut for transaction struct
	- Updated Transaction.xs to implement syswrite and sysread
	- Updated svn:keyword property

2009-04-15  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added a common model.h file for storing data structure models (ie the journal struct)
	- Implemented a few functions for Transaction, including sysread and syswrite
	- Added option for sysopen to change permissions (defaults to 0666)

2009-04-12  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added a typemap file
	- Wrote some of the code for IO::Journal and IO::Journal::Transaction. Some basic stuff can be done now, including opening a file and beginning a transaction. It's not very useful right now since the write functionality hasn't been implemented yet, though.
	- Added a wrapper for sysopen() to provide a common open()-like interface (ie to convert '>' flags to the Fcntl style flags)
	- TODO: write a bootstrapper for IO::Journal::Transaction
	- Added Build.PL code to set up the build environment using getconf, with defaults if getconf is not installed
	- Set dynamic_config to 1, since special stuff needs to be done now (setting up the build environment)
	- These bindings rely on a system-wide installation of libjio. A second module is forthcoming (proposed name IO::Journal::Amalgamation) which will include the libjio files in the src tree

2009-04-11  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	- Added skeleton code
	- Made Test::NoWarnings a required build prerequisite
	- Set up svn:keywords for everything
	- Updated MANIFEST file

2009-04-10  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Creation of IO-Journal stub package

2009-04-10  Jonathan Yu <frequency@cpan.org>

	Creation of IO-Journal stub directory - for a module providing transaction-oriented journalling I/O :-)
